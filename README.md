Whats up guys, glad you made it here. 
We're going to be working in the cloud in the 'Dashboard' code space under the 'code' tab. 
There are a number of library dependencies for this dahsboard that I've tried my best to resolve in the requirements.txt file. 
We'll be using a jupyter notebook runtime supplied through GitHub, so I'm not sure how that's will go, but so far no problems. 
If you look at the script titled Source.py, and you run all the cells, a window should pop up directing you to the http server port that hosts the dashboard
Your changes to the code will be committed and logged so we can really hone in on making a good product. 

Cordially,
Logan K
